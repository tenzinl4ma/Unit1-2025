proposed soution
I am proposing, to create a simple tool calculator which contains a secret fucntion taht is only revealed when a hidden code is entered, once the correct secret code is typed into the simple tool , it transform into a the pawweord manager that my client rquires. this is a n adequate solution for my cleient because it solves the problem or keeping passwrod  manager that my client requires. This is an adequate solution for my client becuase it solvees the problem or keeping password information both protected and hidden.

# Criterai A

## Success Criteria
Requirements:
Basic Calculator Functionality:
1. The calculator should accept user input to perform basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
1. Ensure it can handle typical errors (e.g., division by zero) and give appropriate feedback.
1. Hidden Functionality:
1. If the user enters the secret code ("open123"), the program will change modes and act as a password manager.
1. In password manager mode, the user should be able to:
*Add a password (for example, for a website).
*View the stored passwords (only if they re-enter the secret code).
1. Use the terminal to interact with the user.

1.Optionally, display the passwords in a "masked" form (e.g., showing only the first and last characters).
1.Basic Security Features:
1.Store passwords in a text file.
HL: Implement a basic obfuscation technique or basic encryption (e.g., reversing the password string or shifting characters by a fixed number)
